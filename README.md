### Custom updations in the SuiteCRM for the Customer verification process.


1. There are a few changes are done in the existing PHP files such as /include/ListView/ListViewData.php
   (The alterations are evident within lines 615 to 633, where the pre-existing code was commented out to prevent potential errors or for future utilization when necessary. In this context, a modified code segment was introduced, occupying lines 634 to 645.)

2. A new database table has been introduced to maintain a comprehensive record of each OTP (One-Time Password) sent to customer IDs, along with the corresponding delivery method. 
   This initiative serves the dual purpose of preserving a history of customer verifications and facilitating user verification through the recorded OTP codes.

3. Two files, namely "verify.php" and "otp_send.php," have been integrated into the existing software and linked within the "ListViewData.php" table, as indicated in line number 1. 
   The "verify.php" file comprises a collection of verification methods retrieved from database tables, which are then presented in a dropdown list. The Customer Service Representative (CSR) has the capability to select the desired verification method requested by the customer. Subsequently, an OTP is dispatched to fulfill the chosen verification process.

4. On the subsequent screen (accessible via "send_top.php"), the Customer Service Representative (CSR) will input the OTP code into the designated fields, as shared by the customer.
   Successful completion of the verification process hinges on a code match between the entered OTP and the corresponding record in our database table. In the event of a mismatch, the verification attempt will be unsuccessful and an accompanying error message will be displayed.
